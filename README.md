# IoT_project
Course project for Internet of things @ Uni Oulu

Note: Currently you must create a personal api key from https://openweathermap.org/ by creating
      an account and subscribing to the free version of Current weather and forecasts collection
      at https://openweathermap.org/price . It might take 2 hours for the key to become active!
      After it is active simply insert it into scripts.js const api=<API_KEY> on line 2.
